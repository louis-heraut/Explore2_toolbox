**Ex2D_toolbox** is a **R toolbox** based on [Ex2D](https://github.com/super-lou/Ex2D) and [MKstat](https://github.com/super-lou/MKstat) packages. Its main objective is to provide a simple way of interacting with all these codes to carry out diagnostic of the hydrological models used in [Explore2](https://professionnels.ofb.fr/fr/node/1244).
